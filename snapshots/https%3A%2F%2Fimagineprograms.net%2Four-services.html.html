            <h4 class="heading-3">Intensive Outpatient Treatment<br></h4>
            <p class="aboutp">At Imagine Programs, we understand that seeking help for a substance abuse problem is a difficult yet responsible decision. Some people seek treatment because they are genuinely tired of the negative and detrimental impact substance abuse has had on their lives. Others may seek treatment because they are required to, and they are unsure as to whether or not they have a problem. Regardless of your reason for seeking treatment, you will find a supportive and safe environment in where you have the opportunity to make positive changes in your life.<br></p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="aboutp">Imagine Programs offers both adolescent and adult Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOP) Services. IOP Treatment is a group counseling treatment program consisting of the following elements:</p>

        </ul>
        <p class="aboutp">At Imagine Programs, IOP group counseling is three days a week. For Adult participants, morning and evening group counseling sessions are offered to accommodate work, school, or family schedules.<br><br>For our Teenage participants, group counseling sessions are held in the evenings as to prevent interference with school activities. In addition to group counseling, Imagine Programs offers family counseling, individual counseling, and a Family Education Class that all parents are encouraged to attend.</p>
        <h4 class="heading-3 top-margin">Evaluations/Assessments<br></h4>
        <p class="aboutp">Imagine Programs offers substance abuse evaluations and assessments that are conducted by our highly qualified staff members. Our evaluation and assessments are conducted using a comprehensive assessment tool that assesses the extent of a substance abuse problem.<br><br>After the Evaluation / Assessment process, a recommendation is made by the counselor as to what level of care is needed. All aspects of the recommendations will be staffed with you and your family if needed. Recommendations can also be staffed with any referring agencies if requested. We are here to answer any questions about what is recommended and make sure that everyone involved is comfortable with the decisions that are made.<br></p>
        <h4 class="heading-3 top-margin">Family Services<br></h4>
        <p class="aboutp"><em>Family Counseling<br>‍</em>In addition to the Intensive Outpatient Treatment Program, Imagine Programs believes that family involvement in treatment is an essential part of developing long term sobriety. Imagine Programs believes that Addiction is a family disease, meaning that if a member of the family has an addiction problem, it affects the entire family structure. Imagine Programs offers family counseling sessions as part of the IOP program where a home contract is developed as well as bridging the gap between behaviors at home and in treatment. The Staff understands that having a substance dependent family member in the home can be very difficult, frustrating, and stressful. We want to help offer family support and guidance through these difficult times.<br><br>‍<em>Family Support Meetings<br>‍</em>Imagine Programs also offers family support meetings where parents of teens who are in the programs can meet and support each other in their efforts in bridging the gap between treatment and home. We strongly recommend that parents attend these support group meetings as it is essential that families understand and talk about the addiction and recovery process. Parent Support Meetings are a valuable way for family members to share information and ideas about how to cope with the stressors of having a substance dependent family member in the home.<br></p>
