            <p class="paragraph-services">A dental cleaning is a professional cleaning you receive from a dentist or dental hygienist. Cleanings should be performed every six months to prevent excessive plaque buildup. Plaque left untreated can lead to unhealthy gums and tooth decay.<br>‍<br><strong>Scaling: </strong>This is the process of removing plaque and tartar from all tooth surfaces in a variety of methods, depending on the amount of plaque and tartar. <br>‍<br>Dental hygienists traditionally perform scaling by hand. However, new and advanced technology has lead to more modern methods such as electric scalers. This sophisticated tool allows dental cleanings to be performed more efficiently and in less time. To achieve best results, both electric and manual scaling methods are combined for dental cleanings. </p>

          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">Maintaining good oral hygiene is one of the most important things you can do for your teeth and gums. Healthy teeth not only enable you to look and feel good, they make it possible to eat and speak properly. Good oral health is important to your overall well-being. Daily preventive care, including proper brushing and flossing, will help stop problems before they develop.<br>‍<br>In between regular visits to the dentist, there are simple steps that each of us can take to greatly decrease the risk of developing tooth decay, gum disease and other dental problems. These include:</p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li class="paragraph-services">Brush thoroughly twice a day and floss daily</li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Eat a balanced diet and limit snacks between meals</li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Use dental products that contain fluoride, including toothpaste</li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Rinse with a fluoride mouth rinse if your dentist advises you to</li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Make sure that your children under 12 drink fluoridated water or take a fluoride supplement if they live in a non-fluoridated area</li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Eat a balanced diet and limit between-meal snacks</li>

            <h5 class="services-header">Sealants</h5>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">Sealants are used to fill in narrow grooves in a tooth that cannot be adequately cleaned by brushing. In some cases, the tooth structure has fine grooves or pits which accumulate plaque, not because the person doesn't brush, but because they're too narrow to allow even one bristle into them. These will develop cavities over time, and you don't want that. So the dentist will brush on a coating that seals the grooves and pits, making it possible to brush off all the plaque and keep your teeth healthy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-cell _1">
            <h5 class="services-header">Fillings</h5>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">A filling is a way to restore a tooth damaged by decay back to its normal function and shape. If you have a tooth that requires a filling, the dentist will first remove the decayed tooth material, clean the affected area, and then fill the cleaned out cavity with a filling material. A filling also helps prevent further decay by closing off any cracks or spaces where bacteria can enter.<br>‍<br>There are a variety of filling materials available including <strong>gold, silver, plastic and porcelain.</strong> The dentist will work with you to determine which material is best for you, depending on the extent of repair, where in your mouth the filling is needed, and cost.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-cell _1">
            <h5 class="services-header">Nightguards</h5>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">Custom designed mouthguards and nightguards are made of flexible plastic and molded to fit the shape of your teeth. Mouthguards are recommended to protect the jaw and teeth during physical activity and sports such as boxing, football, basketball, or other activities where your mouth may get hit. In addition, these guards protect the soft tissues of your tongue, lips and cheek lining. Nightguards are recommended for patients who clench or grind their teeth at night as a way to protect their teeth and bite.<br>‍<br>If you have decided a guard is right for you, the dentist will take an impression of your teeth which will then be sent to a lab to make a custom fit guard for you. In most cases you can choose from a variety of colors and styles for your guard. On average, guards last between 3 and 10 years.</p>

            <h5 class="services-header">Implants</h5>
          </div>
          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">A dental implant is an ideal tooth restoration for people who are missing one or more teeth as a result of injury, periodontal disease, or any other reason. A dental implant is a metal post that a periodontist or oral surgeon surgically positions into the jaw. Once in place and bone surrounding the implant has had time to heal, a replacement tooth is attached to the post. While implants are typically more expensive than other methods of tooth replacement, they provide superior benefits. Implants are stronger than natural teeth and generally last 10-20 years. They are also a more favorable approach than bridgework since they do not depending on neighboring teeth for support.<br>‍<br>To receive implants, you need to have healthy gums and adequate bone to support the implant. You must also be committed to excellent oral hygiene and regular dental visits as these are critical to the long-term success of dental implants. </p>

            <p class="paragraph-services">A denture is a removable replacement for missing teeth and surrounding tissues. <strong>There are two types of dentures available, including partial and complete dentures.</strong> Partial dentures are used when some natural teeth remain, while complete dentures are used to completely replace all teeth. Dentures are made to resemble your natural teeth so there should be no noticeable change to your appearance. In fact, dentures may even improve your smile!</p>

            <p class="paragraph-services">Tooth whitening is a popular procedure to make teeth whiter and brighter, and therefore more attractive.

          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">Veneers are a dental procedure in which a covering is placed over the outside (visible area) of the tooth. Veneers are usually only done to the part of the teeth that are visible when talking or smiling. The procedure can be direct or indirect.<br>‍<br>The advantage of veneers versus crowns is that much less tooth material is removed, and the procedure is generally less uncomfortable. Veneers are recommended for teeth that have large fillings or little tooth structure.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-services">You are not alone if you have some level of dental anxiety. Many people delay or put off dental treatment all together due to fear and anxiety. At The Dental Center of Idaho, we are here to help you achieve optimum oral health and are pleased to be able to offer various levels of sedation. Dental sedation allows you to be able to get the care that you need in a safe and comfortable environment. These sedation options include both nitrous-oxide (sometimes called laughing gas) as well as IV sedation. <br><br><br>Intravenous (IV) sedation allows you to be relaxed during the whole dental appointment. IV sedation works by supplying medication into a vein, usually in your arm, which has a rapid effect to calm and relax you. Because the effects are very rapid, it allows your provider to have precise control over the medication you are receiving which ultimately makes sedation very safe. The vast majority of patients do not remember anything from their appointment. It is sometimes described as “twilight zone” sedation because you can still understand and respond to communication.<br><br>IV sedation is very beneficial for patients in the following situations:</p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li class="paragraph-services">Patients with moderate to high dental anxiety/phobia.<br></li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Patients who would like to complete most or all of an extensive treatment plan in one appointment.<br></li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Third molar (wisdom teeth) removal.<br></li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Multiple extractions and denture fitting.<br></li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Special needs.<br></li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Medical conditions worsened by stress.<br></li>
              <li class="paragraph-services">Difficulty getting and staying numb.<br></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="paragraph-services">A consultation appointment is needed prior to an IV sedation appointment.<br><br>Nitrous-oxide is breathed in during the appointment and helps to lessen anxiety. It can work very well for young children to help them have a good experience while getting treatment completed. A benefit of nitrous-oxide sedation is you will be able to function normally (ie. drive) after your appointment is over. Please let us know if you are interested in any of the sedation options we offer.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-services">We use digital imaging software in our office, which allows us to take a digital picture of you and use our imaging system to predict how a particular treatment or cosmetic procedure would change the appearance of your teeth. This software is beneficial for patients who are considering cosmetic procedures but are not sure if they’re ready for dramatic changes. Digital imaging also allows us to document your dental case and procedures very well. We take digital images of your face, teeth and smile to provide us with a permanent dental record and to provide a visual documentation of treatment.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-services">Good oral hygiene should always be practiced since the loss of a single tooth can have major impact upon your oral health and appearance. Although dentists will use every measure to prevent tooth loss, there still sometimes necessary occasions when a tooth may need to be extracted. A tooth may need to be extracted if the following occurs:</p>

          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">The gums, ligaments, and bone around the teeth form the foundation for ones teeth. All structures are also referred to as the periodontium. When the periodontium is not healthy, it jeopardizes the teeth just as a bad foundation would threaten the stability of a house. <br><br>Signs of unhealthy periodontium include: gums that are red and bleed easily, persistent bad breath, gums that are pulled away from the tooth, loose teeth, and changes in the position or bite of the teeth. <br><br>Any of these may be a sign of problem. With proper gum treatments, however, it may be possible to return gum tissue to a healthy state. If you're having a problem, come in and see us so we may treat it right away.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">Root canal treatment (also referred to as root canal therapy or endodontic therapy) is made necessary when a cavity is allowed, through neglect, to reach all the way to this pulp. (Regular cleanings and checkups prevent and detect problems early) Sometimes deep restorations or trauma to a tooth may cause the nerve to be damaged to the point it needs root canal therapy, also. Once this occurs the pulp becomes infected, and can even extend through the root tip and begin to eat away at the surrounding bone (this is an abscess). By the time the pulp is infected it must be treated, and cannot heal on its own. It can even weaken the entire immune system. This is dangerous, not to mention very painful. Symptoms that the pulp has become infected may include sensitivity to hot/cold or sweets, pain, swelling, pain to biting or pressure, and a bad taste in the mouth.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">X-rays are a focused beam of x-ray particles passed through bone which produce an image on special film, showing the structure through which it passed. This provides the familiar black and white images doctors and dentists use to diagnose problems and disease. Without an x-ray of the whole tooth and supporting bone and gum tissues, there would be no way to detect infection or pathology that requires attention.<br>‍<br>In our office we use digital radiography which allows us to take x-rays using up to 90% less radiation than conventional film x-rays. Using this technology, we are able to take an x-ray of your mouth by using a small sensor which records the image of your teeth and sends it to a computer. The result is a highly detailed image of your mouth that can easily be enhanced to better diagnosis dental concerns and determine the very best treatment for each case.</p>

          <div class="feature-cell right">
            <p class="paragraph-services">We use small cameras about the size of a pen, called intraoral cameras, to help clearly see the condition of your teeth and gums.<br>‍<br>With this advanced technology we can zoom in on small diseased areas, cracks, chips and worn metal fillings with extreme precision. The full-color images taken with the intraoral camera are sent to a computer screen so we can clearly see and diagnose dental problems much earlier than with traditional dental technology. Because images are displayed on our screens, patients will also be able to see areas being worked on and are able to gain a better understanding of dental procedures being performed.</p>

          <div class="feature-cell right last">
            <p class="paragraph-services">Crowns and bridges are used to restore and enhance teeth that are damaged, or to take the place of missing teeth. A crown, also referred to as a cap, is used to entirely cover a damaged tooth. A crown not only strengthens a tooth, but it can dramatically improve a tooth’s appearance, shape and alignment. <br>‍<br>Bridges are an ideal method to fill the space created by missing teeth. A bridge is one or more artificial teeth that are cemented into place using the teeth on either side for support, hence the name. This is an option for filling the space created by a missing tooth. A bridge replaces the missing tooth, both functionally and cosmetically.</p>
